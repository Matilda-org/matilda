# Docs generation prompt

I have to create a landing page to promote and show the features of Matilda, a project manager developed in Ruby on Rails.
The landing page should show the same content as the README file, but in a more visually appealing way. Ignore the sections "Installazione" and "Integrazioni". The page should be commercial and not technical.
The landing page should be a single HTML file with Tailwind CSS for styling.
Use the Italian language for the text.

Use the images already used on the README file. The images are located in the `docs` folder of the project repository. The link on the landing page should be changed by removing the `docs/` prefix from the image path.

The main colors of the project are:
$primary: #181d45;
$secondary: #19405d;
$light: #dde5f2;
$dark: #181d22;

This is the link of the project repository:
https://github.com/Matilda-org/matilda

This is the README file:
